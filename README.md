# asc-ImageJ-MorphologicalCentroids
<p>Very simple ImageJ macros that add morphological centroids to the Results table based on the &quot;MCentroids.txt&quot; example macro by Gabriel Landini: <a href="https://blog.bham.ac.uk/intellimic/g-landini-software/">Link</a>. These macros require <a href="https://blog.bham.ac.uk/intellimic/g-landini-software/">Gabriel Landini's &quot;Morphology&quot; plugin</a>. These centroidsÂ  are obtained by thinning objects (assuming white objects) and thus are always within object boundaries, making them useful for labeling objects. The Morphological Centroids can also be generated on request by our object labeling macros if the Morphology plugin is available.</p>
